 <b>How much is the Thar’s price?</b><br>
<i>The 2024 Mahindra Thar starts at a price of Rs 11.35 lakh (ex-showroom) for the base diesel manual rear-wheel drive model and goes up to Rs 17.60 lakh for the top-end diesel automatic 4x4 Earth Edition, which is a special-edition Thar based on the fully-loaded LX variant.</i><br>

 <b>How many variants are there in the Mahindra Thar?</b><br>
<i>There are two variants of the Mahindra Thar 2024: AX Option and LX. These variants can be had with a standard hard-top roof or a manually-folding soft-top roof (convertible) with choices of petrol or diesel engines and manual or automatic transmissions.</i><br>

 <b>Which is the most value for money variant? </b><br>
<i>The Mahindra Thar’s fully-loaded LX variant is its value for money variant. The base AX Option variant is cheaper but misses out on features like steering-mounted audio and phone controls, cruise control, 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with speakers, tyre pressure monitoring and electrically-adjustable mirrors. For these added features, the LX commands reasonable price premium of around Rs 50,000-60,000 and is worth spending more for.</i><br>

<b>What features does the Thar get? </b><br>
<i>The Mahindra Thar offers features like a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, 4 speakers with 2 tweeters, tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS), ESP, ISOFIX, dual front airbags and a height-adjustable driver’s seat.</i><br>

<b>How safe is the Mahindra Thar?</b><br>
<i>The Mahindra Thar comes equipped with safety features like dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, hill-hold control, hill-descent control and rear parking sensors. In Global NCAP’s crash tests, it has also received 4/5 stars for both adult and child occupant protection.</i><br>

        <b>Latest Update</b>: <i>The Tata Nexon gets three new Smart variants for both petrol and diesel powertrain options.</i><br>

<b>How much is the Nexon’s price?</b>

<i>Prices for the Tata Nexon start at Rs 8 lakh (ex-showroom) for the base petrol-manual mode and go up to Rs 15.80 lakh for the top-end diesel-automatic.</i><br>

 <b>How many variants are there in Tata Nexon?</b>

<i>The Tata Nexon 2024 is offered in four broad variants: Smart, Pure, Creative and Fearless. Each of these four gets further sub-variants with suffixes like (O), Plus and S. Some of these variants are also available with the #Dark edition treatment. The Dark edition is a popular cosmetic special edition that Tata also offers on other models in its range, such as the Harrier and Safari.</i><br>

<b>Which is the most value for money variant?</b>

<i>If you’re on a stricter budget, the Nexon Pure variant offers good value by offering the basic comforts you would expect from a lower-spec model. However, if you have the budget for a feature-loaded sub-4m SUV, the Nexon Fearless + variant offers the best balance between features and price, especially for those who prioritize an automatic transmission. It boasts a sunroof, ventilated front seats, six airbags, 360-degree camera, and more. Automatic transmission options for these Nexon Fearless variants start from around Rs 14 lakh.</i><br>
